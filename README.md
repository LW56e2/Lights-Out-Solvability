This repository contains a list of numbers, `n`, for which the `n Ã— n` square game of Lights Out does not neccesarily have a solution. This equivalently means that the matrix which turns a 'click' vector (a vector consisting of a 1 in the index of the position of the board to be clicked and 0's elsewhere) into a 'change' vector (a vector consisting of 1's that indicates which indices of lights will be toggled) is non-invertible. If this matrix were invertible, all games of Lights Out of this size would be solvable.
